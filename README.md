# drowsiness-detection
**Overview**
This project is aimed at detecting drowsiness in real-time using computer vision techniques. It utilizes facial landmark detection to monitor the eyes and detect signs of drowsiness based on eye closure
**Features**
-Real-time drowsiness detection using webcam or video input.
-Facial landmark detection to monitor eye movement and closure.
-Adjustable threshold for drowsiness detection to accommodate different scenarios.
-Simple and intuitive user interface.
**Requirements**
-Python 3.x
-OpenCV
-Dlib
-NumPy
-Imutils
-Pygame (for audio alerts)
**Installation**
-Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/mrMusharaf/drowsiness-detection.git
-Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
**Usage**
-Run the main script:
    python main.py
-Adjust the threshold parameter for drowsiness detection as needed.
-Ensure proper lighting conditions for optimal performance.
-Sit in front of the camera and observe the drowsiness detection alerts.
